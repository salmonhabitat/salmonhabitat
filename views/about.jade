  h3 About SHARE
  p 
    | Formed in 1994 by stakeholders with widely different interests, goals 
    | and viewpoints, SHARE was created as a cooperative forum to contribute 
    | to Atlantic salmon recovery via habitat restoration. Membership is 
    | open to all stakeholders and members are expected to abide by a set 
    | of guidelines based on voluntary participation and cooperation, mutual 
    | respect and commitment to SHARE’s mission. Goodwill among members 
    | is maintained by remaining neutral on political issues and focusing 
    | on win-win opportunities from a land management and conservation 
    | standpoint.
