    h2 Our Mission

    p Hi! We're SHARE, or Salmon Habitat and River Enhancement.
    p 
      | We’re a nonprofit 501(c)(3) looking to restore fish passage and 
      | natural stream function to benefit Atlantic salmon and other 
      | native fishes. Since 2005, we’ve improved and/or opened up A LOT of 
      | previously  inaccessible habitat – over 100 miles (2800+ habitat units).
    p 
      | Formed in 1994 by stakeholders with widely different interests, goals 
      | and viewpoints, SHARE was created as a cooperative forum to contribute 
      | to Atlantic salmon recovery via habitat restoration. Membership is 
      | open to all stakeholders and members are expected to abide by a set 
      | of guidelines based on voluntary participation and cooperation, mutual 
      | respect and commitment to SHARE’s mission. Goodwill among members 
      | is maintained by remaining neutral on political issues and focusing 
      | on win-win opportunities from a land management and conservation 
      | standpoint.
