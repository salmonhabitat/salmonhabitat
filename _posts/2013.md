First of all, we hope you all had an excellent holiday!

Now that the holidays are over, it's resolution season. This year, SHARE is working on communicating more effectively with our peers. Communication, and how to improve it, is a perennial issue that's brought up at every meeting and gathering we attend. So we're focusing on it this year.

So, how are we going to do that?

### 1. [Restoration Notes](https://tinyletter.com/salmonhabitat)

We've started [Restoration Notes](https://tinyletter.com/salmonhabitat), a bi-weekly-ish newsletter where we'll cover everything of note that's happening in the Downeast Restoration community. It's probably the best way to stay up to date with our work! If that's of interest to you, please, [sign up!](https://tinyletter.com/salmonhabitat).

We'll be sending our first issue out early next week.

### 2. [Salmondata.org](http://salmondata.org)

We're getting ready to launch [Salmondata](http://salmondata.org)! We hope to use the site to facilitate the sharing of data and events pertinant to the Downeast Maine salmon restoration community. It is a private website, meaning that you'll need a username and password to access data that's been uploaded by other members, or to add any new events to the calendar. Hopefully, that means better coordination and less duplication of efforts across organizations. Less work, more end product. We're hoping to open the site up in mid-February, but for now, if you're interested, add your email to the list!

Salmondata is a very new initiative for us. More than anything, we want this to be beneficial to the community. If you have suggestions, we'd love to hear them. Send an email to [Jacques](mailto:jacquestardie@gmail.com) if you have any questions or comments.

That's all for now. Good luck with those resolutions.
