Removal of the Sunday River log/crib dam was a collaboration of The Androscoggin Valley Soil & Water Conservation District, Maine Inland Fish and Wildlife, USFWS Gulf of Maine Program, Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture.

The dam was located in a gorge making it difficult and cost prohibitive to access with construction equipment. 

Not a problem. We employed hand labor and two “grip hoists”. 

A day and ½ later the dam was gone.
