SHARE spent a few days last week helping to remove a(nother) remnant dam on the Sunday River.

Steve and I met up with Bobby van Riper's crew from [MEIF&W](http://www.maine.gov/ifw/), Jeff Sterns from the [Androscoggin Watershed Council](http://arwc.camp7.org/), Sue Gammon from the [Androscoggin Valley Soil and  Water Conservation District](http://www.androscogginswcd.org/), Jed Wright, and Alex Abbott. Aside from wanting to remove what's been a passage barrier for at least 100 years, they wanted to check out how the griphoist worked, and we wanted to show it off.
