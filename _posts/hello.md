In the last four or five years my thoughts have been coalescing into a strange, self-reinforcing amalmagation. Like a good pet, it's always there by my side, shaping and directing my activities in ways that *feel* correct. The problem is that the feeling is more intuitive than logical. More of a comfort than something solid I can stand on.

Which is why I'm starting to write. Putting words on paper forces me to think more logically. Faults in my reasoning are more visible once they've been scribbled out.

So, that's the plan. Looking forward to any conversations this might begin.
