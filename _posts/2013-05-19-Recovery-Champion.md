It's a pleasure to announce that Steve has been named a USFWS' 2012 Recovery Champion!

There's a great interview with him over at the USFWS Blog, ['Conserving the Nature of the Northeast'](http://usfwsnortheast.wordpress.com) that you should check out.

> The ultimate satisfaction comes at the end of the day, once the excavators and pumps are shut off, workers leave the site, and I am able to quietly sit and hear a stream that once again can flow naturally.
