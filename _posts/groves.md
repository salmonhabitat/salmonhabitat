Supported by some *excellent* volunteers, we spent the last few days of August removing a remnant log drive dam at the Groves Mills site on Old Stream.

Often, remnant log drive dams go unnoticed. Visibly subtle, their effects on the fish community can be dramatic. For instance:

- At low flows, remnant dams can impede fish passage.
- They alter the natural stream hydrology of the system, impeding sediment transport.
- They increase water temperature, reducing the competitiveness of native species, and increasing it for exotics.

And they're **everywhere...** So it was great to have so much enthusiatic support on this site. We turned this warm, pool/glide habitat from this:

to this:

It was great!
