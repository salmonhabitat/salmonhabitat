Summary
-------

SHARE conducted a preconstruction site assessment of the 30-00-0 road crossing of West Branch Brook (WBB). WBB is a headwater tributary of the Narraguagas River, and is located within the Beddington Lake HUC12, which was previously identified to be the top priority focus area for Altantic salmon restoration in the Narraguagas River.

Project SHARE has previously completed a road crossing inventory of the entire focus area, of which, the the 30-00-0 crossing at WBB is the largest project. The culvert appears to be located directly on top of a legacy dam site, and has been assessed as a velocity barrier to the upstream migration of fish.

The target species that will be affected by restoration efforts at this site include:

- (Endangered) Atlantic salmon
- Eastern Brook Trout
- Sea Lamprey
- American eel
- Alewife
- Blueback herring

Site Assessment
---------------


/* FIGURE 2: AERIAL VIEW OF PROJECT SITE WITH SURVEY ENDPOINTS */


USFWS assisted SHARE staff conducting a field survey of the site including both a longitudinal profile and pebble counts. Ice conditions inhibited the field crew's ability to obtain accurate cross sections. The culvert is a smooth steel pipe approximately 11 feet in diameter and 37.5 feet long. It's set on top of remnant crib work that's evident on both the upstream and downstream side of the road. At this time, it cannot be confimed if the crib work represents wood abutments from a former bridge or a remnant dam site. However, it appears the site may be a former dam site. There is a similar remnant dam structure at the confluence of Barrel Brook which is a tributary immediately downstream of West Branch Brook. Several likely dam sites have been identified in LiDAR imagery in the upper portions of West Branch Brook.


/* FIGURE 3: LONG PROFILE */


The longitudinal profile suggests the culvert may be set an elevation (88 feet) relatively close to the original stream elevation. The stream elevation downstream of the culvert at station 1000 is 87 feet; upstream at station 20 feet the stream elevation is 90 feet. The depth of the plunge pool supports the assessment that the culvert is undersized and represents a high flow velocity barrier. The creation of the plunge pool results in a berm of material downstream of the plunge pool which appears to be 2 feet deep. The berm is well establish and vegetated with alders. There are several small channels exiting the plunge pool rather than a single stream channel.

Upstream of the road there appears to be a sediment wedge at station 250-300 feet. The sediment wedge is the result of a back water condition above the road during high water events. At such time, current velocity above the road diminishes in the back water and the sediment load is deposited upstream of the road.

West branch brook is a sand/gravel based substrate: d50 is 4.7 mm and d95 36 mm (Figure 6).
