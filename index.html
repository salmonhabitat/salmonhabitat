	<section class='story-what'>
		<h2>A little about us</h2>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Our partners love us.</span> SHARE engages collaboratively with our partners to find solutions that fit financially, ecologically, and that exceed regulatory requirements. We're efficient, and have a history of completing projects underbudget. Our network of contractors are experienced in habitat restoration projects, allowing us to get work done fast. And we're able to acquire funding from a variety of sources, allowing landowners to engage in restoration efforts that would otherwise be impossible.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>We're focused on enabling good relationships.</span> SHARE was formed in 1994 as a cooperative forum where a variety of stakeholders could contribute to Atlantic salmon restoration efforts. Goodwill among members is maintained by remaining neutral on political issues and focusing on win-win opportunities from a land management and conservation standpoint. <a href='/about'>Learn more about who we are.</a></p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>SHARE has a history of success.</span> Because of the excellent relationships SHARE has with it's peers, we've won <a href='/awards'>a variety of awards</a>.</p>

	<section class='story-why'>
		<h2>Why the work we do is important</h2>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Maine's rivers have been altered.</span> The log-drive era profoundly affected the shape of Maine's rivers and streams. Dams were constructed, channels were straightened, and complexity was reduced in an effort to make it easier to get lumber downstream. Additionally, starting in the 1950's, road networks became increasingly important to the timber industry, resulting in an increasing amount of road-stream crossings.</p>

	<section class='story-how'>
		<h2>How we achieve results</h2>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Open-bottom arch culverts.</span> By spanning the bankfull channel width, open-bottom arch culverts allow natural stream processes to occur. In addition to restoring the stream's capacity to move nutrients and sediments, fish passage is dramatically improved. Open-bottom arch culverts are relatively maintenance free, and once installed, can often be left untouched for 70 years.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Large woody debris additions</span> help to address the lack of naturally occuring wood in Downeast Maine's streams. Additions increase the rate at which streams develop complexity, allowing for more numerous and varied habitats for the species using that portion of the stream.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Clamshell additions</span> are a cost-effective means of buffering pH. Many of Maine's watersheds lack significant levels of basic pH buffers. Combined with acid rain and backwaters which form peats and bogs, this often results in highly acidic streams that aren't conducive to insect or animal life. By adding clamshells, we create more pH neutral environments which benefit the local fauna.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>We educate the next generation.</span>SHARE works with local schools and colleges to provide students with both restoration experience, and tthe understanding of why it's important. We help others to understand how 'natural' streams should function, and why they often don't.</p>
