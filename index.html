	<section class='story-what'>
		<h2>A little about us.</h2>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>We focus on enabling good relationships.</span> SHARE was formed in 1994 as a cooperative forum where stakeholders could contribute to Atlantic salmon restoration efforts. Goodwill amongst our members is maintained by remaining neutral on political issues and focusing on win-win opportunities from a land management and conservation standpoint. <a href='/about'>Learn more about who we are.</a></p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>We work collaboratively</span> with our partners to find solutions that are both ecologically and financially efficient. SHARE leverages a variety of funding sources to enable landowners to take on projects they wouldn't be able to do alone.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>We're experienced.</span> SHARE has completed over 150 restoration projects in the last 10 years. Our network of contractors are experienced in habitat restoration projects, allowing us to get work done faster than would be possible otherwise.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>SHARE has a history of success.</span>  Due in large part to our excellent partners, SHARE has been the recipient of <a href='/awards'>numerous awards</a>. And we plan on winning more.</p>

	<section class='story-why'>
		<h2>Why our work is necessary.</h2>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>The log-drive era dramatically altered the shape of Maine's rivers and streams.</span> Dams were constructed, channels were straightened, and complexity was reduced in an effort to make it easier to get lumber downstream.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>The number of road-stream crossings</span> has increased dramatically since the 1950's, as Maine's timber industry shifted from it's means of extracting wood from rivers to roads. While hydraulically sufficient, many of these crossings affect natural stream processes. Individually, the effects may be negligible; cumulatively, they're dramatic.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Atlantic salmon are endangered</span>, and unless we work to rehabilitate their habitat, it's unlikely that they'll be able to recover. We've already improved over 2,800 habitat units, but more will be required.</p>

	<section class='story-how'>
		<h2>How we achieve success.</h2>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Open-bottom arch culverts.</span> By spanning the bankfull channel width, open-bottom arch culverts allow natural stream processes to occur. In addition to restoring the stream's capacity to move nutrients and sediments, fish passage is dramatically improved. Open-bottom arch culverts are relatively maintenance free, and once installed, can often be left untouched for 70 years.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Large woody debris additions</span> help to address the lack of naturally occuring wood in Downeast Maine's streams. Additions increase the rate at which streams develop complexity, allowing for more numerous and varied habitats for the species using that portion of the stream.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Clamshell additions</span> are a cost-effective means of buffering pH. Many of Maine's watersheds lack significant levels of basic pH buffers. Combined with acid rain and backwaters which form peats and bogs, this often results in highly acidic streams that aren't conducive to insect or animal life. By adding clamshells, we create more pH neutral environments which benefit the local fauna.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Education.</span>SHARE works with local schools and colleges to provide students with both restoration experience, and the understanding of why it's important. We help others to understand how 'natural' streams should function, and why they often don't.</p>

		<h2>How you can help.</h2>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Join us in the field.</span> We spend the Spring, Summer, and Fall out and about in Downeast Maine, working on our restoration. Helping hands are always welcome. Bring your team; the work is rewarding.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Attend a training.</span> SHARE offers a variety of educational opportunities for all levels. Our <em>Stream-Smart</em> trainings offer a glimpse of what it takes to restore and analyze watersheds and their associated road-stream crossing structures. Alternatively, our we've partnered with the USFS to offer a weeklong <em>Stream simulation</em> training course which goes into much greater detail.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Contribute with your experience.</span> SHARE is always looking for new voices. If you're actively involved in stream restoration, join us at one of our Quarterly Meetings in Whitneyville, ME.</p>
		<p><span class='story-lead'>Donate.</span> It takes a lot to keep SHARE running, and able to restore Maine's fluvial systems. Help us 'keep the lights on'.</p>
